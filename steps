    //homepage button
    //show original method
    //created method
    //added two arrays and mapped throug to set each to lowercase and then for each in unitLong replace with unitShort
    //replace parenthesis with space or nothing
    //create array by splitting at ' '
    //created unitIndex by finding the index in the newly split arrays. Find index where arrIngredients includes unitsShort
    //if unit index was greater than -1 unit, parseInt(arrIng[0] === true) maybe unit, === -1 no unit
    //1) create new array by slice at 0 to unitIndex, aka how many there were
    //   - if array length === 1 set count = to first index and replace - with +
     //   - else evaluate array ingredients sliced at 0, to unit index and join with + 

    //   set count = count, unit = arrIngredients[unitIndex] and ingredient to arrIngredients.slice(unitIndex + 1).join(' ')
    //2) set count = parseInt(arrIng[0]), unit '', and ingredient to arrIngredients.slice(1).join(' ')
    //3) set count = 1, unit '', ingredient to ingredient
    //set ingredients to the new ingredients

    //-------------------------------------------------------------

    //first created new file and function renderRecipe (displays on the ui)
    //took html elements and put them into the new function, using template literals added elements from recipe
